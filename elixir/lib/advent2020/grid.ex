  @moduledoc """
  A `Grid` is a 2D array of single-character strings. Neither Elixir
  nor the Erlang VM have any notion of a standard O(1) access array (!)
  so we use a tuple of tuples to emulate the same. The access
  characteristics are about the same as arrays in other languages, but
  updates can be really slow since the tuple of tuples needs to be
  reconstructed entirely on every change. Thankfully, for our use-case
  we are just creating these things once and not changing them.
